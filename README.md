# ggmetrix

Ggmetrix is currently under development, pull requests are welcome!

#### Features
 - Your custom SQL databases for metrics
 - Simple to setup - just upload binary to your server
 - No client for your language needed - just good old http request to send metrics
 - Metrics aggregation out of the box
 - Admin panel included 

#### Why ggmetrix?

Monitoring systems are usually hard to setup and mantain. Ggmetrics is supposed to solve these problems and offers super simple setup and more awesome features like simple metrics aggregation. Yeah, I wanted to use metrics aggregation in my project, but this feature is either offered by paid services, or it is hard to setup in systems like Prometheus (though for other purposes it is great). That's why ggmetrix was created.

#### TODO:
- counter metrics type
- gauge metrics type
- basic auth for admin panel
- auth in header like jwt
- cLient libs for node.js, php, go
